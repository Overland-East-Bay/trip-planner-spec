# Planning lives in GitHub Issues (draft-first)

## Repo identity
You are working in **`ebo-planner-spec`**: product/spec artifacts (domain model, use-cases, ADRs, OpenAPI source-of-truth).

## Default behavior for planning requests
When the user asks for **planning / approach / design / rollout** (e.g. “help me plan…”, “how should we implement…”, “what’s the approach…”):

- **Do not write a plan markdown file** (or any repo file) unless the user explicitly asks.
- **Stop with a GitHub Issue *draft*** and wait for review/refinement. Expect iterative back-and-forth.
- **Do not create a GitHub issue** unless the user explicitly asks you to create it.

## Choose the right repo for the issue (triage)
Your job is to pick the most appropriate repo for the issue and say so.

- If the work is about **spec content** (use cases, domain model, ADRs, OpenAPI authoring, spec lock discipline), the issue belongs in **`ebo-planner-spec`**.
- If it’s primarily implementation work in another repo (backend/web/cli), still provide the draft, but clearly state **“Suggested repo: …”** and ask for confirmation.
- If ambiguous, ask **one** targeted question: “Which repo should own this issue (spec/backend/web/cli)?”

## GitHub Issue draft format (required)
Output exactly this structure:

### Proposed GitHub Issue (DRAFT — do not create yet)
**Repo**: <ebo-planner-spec | ebo-planner-backend | ebo-planner-web | ebo-planner-cli>
**Title**: <concise, action-oriented>
**Labels**: <optional list, omit if unknown>
**Body**:
- **Problem / Motivation**
- **Goals**
- **Non-goals**
- **Context / Links** (link to relevant spec sections/ADRs/use-cases)
- **Proposed approach**
- **Detailed task breakdown** (checkbox list)
- **Acceptance criteria**
- **Testing / validation**
- **Rollout / release notes** (if applicable)
- **Risks & mitigations**
- **Open questions**

## When asked to create the issue
Only when the user explicitly asks (e.g. “create this issue in spec repo”, “file this in ebo-planner-spec”) you may proceed.

- Confirm/ask for: **repo**, **title**, **labels** (optional), and whether to use the current draft verbatim.
- Then either:
  - Provide a `gh issue create ...` command the user can run, OR
  - Run the `gh issue create` command yourself if the user asked you to create it now.
