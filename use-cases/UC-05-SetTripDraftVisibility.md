# UC-05 — SetTripDraftVisibility

## Primary Actor

Organizer (creator)

## Goal

Toggle a draft between private and public visibility.

## Preconditions

- Caller is authenticated.
- Target draft trip exists and is visible to the caller.

## Postconditions

- System state is updated as described.

---

## Main Success Flow

1. Actor submits a draft visibility change for a given `tripId` with `draftVisibility` in `{PRIVATE, PUBLIC}`.
2. System authenticates the caller.
3. System loads the trip by `tripId` and verifies `status = DRAFT`.
4. System authorizes the caller:
   - Caller must be the trip creator (`created_by_member_id`).
   - If not visible/authorized, return `404 Not Found` (do not reveal existence).
5. System updates `draftVisibility` to the requested value.
6. System returns the updated trip details.

---

## Alternate Flows

A1 — Idempotent No-op (Requested Visibility Already Set)

- **Condition:** Trip `draftVisibility` is already equal to the requested value.
- **Behavior:** System performs no state change.
- **Outcome:** `200 OK` with unchanged trip returned.

A2 — Idempotent Retry (Same Idempotency Key, Same Request)

- **Condition:** A previous successful visibility change exists for the same actor and idempotency key with an identical request payload.
- **Behavior:** System returns the previously returned response (no additional state change).
- **Outcome:** `200 OK` (idempotent).

A3 — Idempotency Key Reuse With Different Payload

- **Condition:** A previous request exists for the same actor and idempotency key, but the new request payload differs.
- **Behavior:** System rejects the request.
- **Outcome:** `409 Conflict`.

---

## Error Conditions

- `401 Unauthorized` — caller is not authenticated
- `404 Not Found` — trip does not exist OR is not visible to the caller
- `409 Conflict` — idempotency key reuse with a different payload (or other invariant violation)
- `422 Unprocessable Entity` — invalid input values (format/range)
- `500 Internal Server Error` — unexpected failure

---

## Authorization Rules

- Caller must be an authenticated member.
- Only the trip creator (`created_by_member_id`) may change `draftVisibility`.
- For non-visible drafts, return `404 Not Found` (do not reveal existence).

## Domain Invariants Enforced

- Trip must be in DRAFT state.
- Only the creator may change draft visibility.
- draftVisibility must be one of PRIVATE or PUBLIC.

---

## Output

- Success DTO containing the updated trip.

---

## API Notes

- Suggested endpoint: `PUT /trips/{tripId}/draft-visibility`
- Prefer returning a stable DTO shape; avoid leaking internal persistence fields.
- Mutating: **require** an `Idempotency-Key` header to safely handle retries.

## Notes

- Aligned with v1 guardrails: members-only, planning-focused, lightweight RSVP, artifacts referenced externally.
